## Note
As it's not really possible to deny you the use of this application and this application is meant to be free and open source software, this statement is here to keep you away from this project.
We do not WANT you to use it. This doesn't mean that you aren't allowed in the development of this software. Your contribution is appreciated, we just don't want you to abuse this software. Sadly, we are aware that you probably will ignore this statement.


We hope to protect us with this statement against those whom might use this software or the knowledge gained from it in a way that doesn't seem to be a force for good.
Please note that accessing any raven crypt server wont give you much more information, as the whole communication is completely end-to-end encrypted and thereby not accessible to the owner of the server.

Anyone setting up a server should also keep logging to a minimum. (other than stats/intrusion detection)
You also can't forge messages or blog-posts, as they are all signed and this will be detected as forgery.


This file is here because open source software seems to be increasingly abused by the wrong kind of people for shit the authors never meant it to be used.
This is a sad development so we hope this file will state the obvious at least in this case.
