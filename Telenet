This is just a lame site doing basic checks (ping, traceroute, whois, geo IP lookup) on some IP you entered in the search form and presents all of that in a scary looking webpage, I definitely wouldn't call that a "security tool", it's more of a toy for script kiddies.

They for some reason assume that you're using a proxy, they can either guess that based on the presence of a Forwarded or X-Forwarded-For header or just because your IP is in some outdated open proxy database - you probably have a dynamic IP and happened to be allocated the IP of someone else who deliberately ran an open proxy or got compromised.

Just forget that horror, here are some (real) tools if you are worried about the security of your computer :

http://icanhazip.com/ - to get the real IP of the host requesting the page (this will be the proxy's IP if you're using one)
http://nmap.org/ - port scanner, run this from a remote host and point it at your IP to scan all open ports on your computer
http://mxtoolbox.com/diagnostic.aspx - open mail relay test, to see if a badly configured mail server is running on your computer and can be abused to send spam
http://www.webmastify.com/resources/proxy/ - open HTTP proxy test, I've not used it myself so I don't know if it's reliable, I prefer to test manually using telnet
