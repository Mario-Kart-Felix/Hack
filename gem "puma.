Details
GHSA-q28m-8xjw-8vr5
high severity
Vulnerable versions: <= 4.3.7
Patched version: 4.3.8
This vulnerability is related to CVE-2019-16770.

Impact
The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster.

A puma server which received more concurrent keep-alive connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections.

Patches
This problem has been fixed in puma 4.3.8 and 5.3.1.

Workarounds
Setting queue_requests false also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using puma without a reverse proxy, such as nginx or apache, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris).

The fix is very small. A git patch is available here for those using unsupported versions of Puma.
