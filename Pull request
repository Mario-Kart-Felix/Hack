## Pull Request Documentation

### Description
This pull request adds a new feature to the project that allows users to sort products by price. The new feature is implemented in the `products` module and includes the following changes:

1. A new function `sortProductsByPrice` has been added to the `products` module.
2. A new API endpoint `/products?sortBy=price` has been added to the server.
3. The API endpoint `/products` has been modified to accept a new query parameter `sortBy`.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this pull request is to provide users with the ability to sort products by price, which is a commonly requested feature.

### Changes Made
The following changes have been made in this pull request:

1. A new function `sortProductsByPrice` has been added to the `products` module. This function sorts the products array by price in ascending order.
2. A new API endpoint `/products?sortBy=price` has been added to the server. This endpoint calls the `sortProductsByPrice` function and returns the sorted products array.
3. The API endpoint `/products` has been modified to accept a new query parameter `sortBy`. This parameter is used to determine whether to sort the products by price or not.

### Testing
The new feature has been tested thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. The following tests have been added:

1. A test to ensure that the new `sortProductsByPrice` function sorts the products array by price in ascending order.
2. A test to ensure that the new API endpoint `/products?sortBy=price` returns the sorted products array.
3. A test to ensure that the API endpoint `/products` returns the unsorted products array when the `sortBy` query parameter is not present.

### Checklist
The following items have been checked off in this pull request:

- [x] The code has been tested thoroughly.
- [x] The documentation has been updated to reflect the changes made.
- [x] The pull request has been reviewed by at least one other developer.

## Complex Sample Documentation

### Description
This is a complex sample that demonstrates how to implement a real-time chat application using Node.js, Socket.io, and React. The sample includes a server that listens for incoming connections and broadcasts messages to all connected clients. The client-side code is implemented using React and Socket.io-client, and allows users to send and receive messages in real-time.

### Installation
To run the sample, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory.
3. Start the server by running `npm run server` in the root directory.
4. Start the client by running `npm run client` in a separate terminal window.

### Usage
Once the sample is up and running, you can open the client in a web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. The client interface allows you to enter a username and start sending messages to the server. The server broadcasts all incoming messages to all connected clients in real-time.

### Code Structure
The sample is divided into two main parts: the server-side code and the client-side code.

//

#### Server-Side Code 

The main server file is `server.js`, which creates a Socket.io server instance and listens for incoming connections. When a client connects, the server adds the client to a list of connected clients and listens for incoming messages. When a message is received, the server broadcasts the message to all connected clients.

The server-side code is organized into the following files:

- `server.js`: The main server file that creates the Socket.io server instance and handles incoming connections and messages.

- `utils.js`: A utility file that contains helper functions for managing the list of connected clients and broadcasting messages.

#### Client-Side Code

The client-side code is implemented using React and Socket.io-client. The main React component is `ChatApp`, which renders a chat interface and handles sending and receiving messages. When the component mounts, it creates a Socket.io-client instance and connects to the server. When the user sends a message, the component emits a message event to the server. When the client receives a message event from the server, it adds the message to the chat history and updates the UI.

The client-side code is organized into the following files:

- `ChatApp.js`: The main React component that renders the chat interface and handles sending and receiving messages.

- `utils.js`: A utility file that contains helper functions for formatting timestamps and generating unique IDs.

### Conclusion

This complex sample demonstrates how to implement a real-time chat application using Node.js, Socket.io, and React. The sample provides a solid starting point for building your own real-time chat application and can be easily customized and extended to meet your specific needs.
