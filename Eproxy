Surface must be clean, dry, and in sound condition. Remove all 
oil, dust, grease, dirt, loose rust, and other foreign material to 
ensure adequate adhesion.
Iron & Steel
Minimum surface preparation is Hand Tool Clean per SSPC-SP2. 
Remove all oil and grease from surface by Solvent Cleaning per 
SSPC-SP1. For better performance, use Commercial Blast Clean-
ing per SSPC-SP6/NACE 3, blast clean all surfaces using a sharp, 
angular abrasive for optimum surface profi le (1.0-2.0 mils / 25-50 
microns). Prime any bare steel within 8 hours or before fl ash rusting 
occurs.
Concrete and Masonry
For surface preparation, refer to SSPC-SP13/NACE 6, or ICRI No. 
310.2R, CSP 1-3. Surfaces should be thoroughly clean and dry. 
Concrete and mortar must be cured at least 28 days @ 75°F (24°C). 
Remove all loose mortar and foreign material. Surface must be 
free of laitance, concrete dust, dirt, form release agents, moisture 
curing membranes, loose cement and hardeners. Fill bug holes, 
air pockets and other voids with Steel-Seam FT910.
Follow the standard methods listed below when applicable:
ASTM D4258 Standard Practice for Cleaning Concrete.
ASTM D4259 Standard Practice for Abrading Concrete.
ASTM D4260 Standard Practice for Etching Concrete.
ASTM F1869 Standard Test Method for Measuring Moisture Vapor 
Emission Rate of Concrete.
SSPC-SP 13/Nace 6 Surface Preparation of Concrete.
ICRI No. 310.2R Concrete Surface Preparation.
Previously Painted Surfaces:
If in sound condition, clean the surface of all foreign material. 
Smooth, hard or glossy coatings and surfaces should be dulled by 
abrading the surface. Apply a test area, allowing paint to dry one 
week before testing adhesion. If adhesion is poor, or if this products 
attacks the previous fi nish, removal of the previous coating may be 
necessary. If paint is peeling or badly weathered, clean surface to 
sound substrate and treat as a new surface as above.
