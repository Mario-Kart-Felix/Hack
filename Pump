Table 4: Purchased coins based on pump likelihood predicted by RF1. Only
coins with predicted pump likelihood of greater than 0.3 are purchased.
Investment weight equals pump likelihood. Q = 0.37, the average of total
transaction volume in a pump-and-dump event in Cryptopia. Only transaction
volume where the buyer is the aggressor is considered.
Table 3 displays the confusion matrix of the model pre-
diction with the test sample. The model suggests us to pur-
chase 9 coins in total, all of which are ultimately pumped.
Table 4 lists those 9 coins, their respective investment weight
and assumed profit. The return on the investment amounts
to 60% (2.61/4.38) over the test sample period of two and
a half months. Note that the effect of transaction fees (0.2%
on Cryptopia) on the investment profitability is negligible.
The result of the final test is very similar to that with both
the training sample and the validation sample when the same
combination of model (RF1) and threshold (0.3) is applied
(Figure 16), confirming the model’s robustness.
5.6 Caveats and Improvement Potential
Data: Upon availability, order book data, tick-by-tick data
before a pump and traders’ account information can also be
included as features.
Modelling method: Random forest with unsupervised
anomaly detection has the potential to improve the model
performance. In addition, other classification (e.g. k-NN) and
regression (e.g. ridge) models are worth considering.
Additional considerations: Regarding investment weights,
one may consider coin price increase potential (based on e.g.
historical returns) in combination with coin pump likelihood.
One must beware that in liquid exchanges, the trading strategy
only applies to small retail investment, since big purchase
orders prior to a pump can move the market, such that pump
organizers may cancel the pump or switch the coin last-minute.
Also worth factoring in is the market risk (e.g. security risk,
legal risk) associated with the nascent crypto-market.
6 Related Work
Over the past year, a handful of studies researching cryptocur-
rency pump-and-dump activities have been conducted, no-
tably Kamps et al. [20] , Li et al. [23] and Hamrick et al. [18].
Our work differs from the aforementioned studies in terms of
motivation, methodology, data, and contribution. We aim for
prospective prediction as opposed to retrospective investiga-
tion of pump-and-dump activities. We use a homogeneous set
of data that only includes clearly announced pump-and-dump
events on Telegram.22 Regarding the sample period, our data
cover a recent time span of June 17, 2018 to February 26, 2019
(Table 5).
Our paper is also closely linked to literature on market ma-
nipulation in non-cryptocurrency contexts. Lin [24] explains
potential damage of various manipulation methods including
pump-and-dump, front running, cornering and mass misinfor-
mation, and argues for swift regulatory action against those
threats. Austin [3] calls for authorities’ demonstration of their
ability to effectively deter market manipulation such as pump-
and-dump in exchanges for small-capped companies, in order
to recover investors’ confidence in trading in those markets,
which would consequently foster economic growth.
Our paper is further related to research on crypto trading.
Gandal et al. [17] demonstrate that the unprecedented spike in
the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013 was possibly caused
by price manipulation. Makarov et al. [25] probe arbitrage
opportunities in crypto markets. Aune et al. [2] highlight po-
tential manipulation in the blockchain market resulting from
the exposure of the footprint of a transaction after its broad-
cast and before its validation in a blockchain, and proposes a
cryptographic approach for solving the information leakage
problems in distributed ledgers.
Our paper is also akin to existing literature on cryptocur-
rencies’ market movements. The majority of related literature
still orients its focus on Bitcoin. Many scholars use GARCH
models to fit the time series of Bitcoin price. Among them,
Dyhrberg et al. [13] explore the financial asset capabilities
of Bitcoin and suggests categorizing Bitcoin as something
between gold and US Dollar on a spectrum from pure medium
of exchange to pure store of value; Bouoiyour et al. [7] argue
that Bitcoin is still immature and remains reactive to nega-
tive rather than positive news at the time of their writing; 2
years later, Conrad et al. [10] present the opposite finding
that negative press does not explain the volatility of Bitcoin;
Dyhrberg [14] demonstrates that bitcoin can be used to hedge
against stocks; Katsiampa [21] emphasizes modelling accu-
racy and recommends the AR-CGARCH model for price
retro-fitting. Bariviera et al. [4] compute the Hurst exponent
by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method and
conclude that the market liquidity does not affect the level of
long-range dependence. Corbet et al. [11] demonstrate that
Bitcoin shows characteristics of an speculative asset rather
than a currency also with the presence of futures trading in
Bitcoin.
Among the few research studies that also look into the finan-
cial characteristics of other cryptocurrencies, Fry et al. [16]
