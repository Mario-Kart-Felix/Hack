beads nested PCR (Taq, Transgen Biotech, China) with
I5 and I7 sequence primers for 16 cycles. Then PCR
products were recovered by size-selection beads (Axygen,
US) followed by PCR (Fastpfu, Transgen Biotech, China)
tagged with Illumina P5 and P7 sequence. All the
PEM-seq libraries were subjected to sequencing by
2 × 150 bp Hiseq.
Plasmid construction
All the gRNA sequences were listed (Supplementary
Table S10). Cas9 targeting gRNAs used the pX330 back-
bone (Addgene 42230) and the Cas9 nickase using
pX335 (Addgene 42335). Cas9 variants, SaCas9 were
inserted into pX330 backbone as follows: Cas9 variants
cDNAs (D1135E, eCas9(1.1), and FeCas9) were generated
by mutation-overlap PCR and then inserted into
pX330 plasmid through AgeI/EcoRI. SaCas9 cDNA was
purified with AgeI/EcoRI from pX601 (Addgene 61591)
and then directly ligated to AgeI/EcoRI-digested pX330
plasmid, and the U6 promoter-SaCas9 gRNA scaffold
DNA from pX601 was inserted into pX330-SaCas9
between AflIII and XbaI. AcrIIA4 plasmid PJH376 was
obtained from Addgene (Addgene 86842).
Cell line and cell transfection
293T, U2OS, and HCT116 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Corning) with
glutamine (Corning), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and
penicillin/streptomycin (Corning) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Corning) with
glutamine, 15% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin (Corn-
ing) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Libraries for HEK293T cells
were prepared by Ca-PO4 co-transfection with 7.2 μg
nuclease plasmid and 1.8 μg pMAX-GFP in 6-cm dishes.
Libraries for U2OS were co-transfected with 20 μg Cas9
plasmid and 5 μg green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid
by PEI (Sigma) in 10 cm dishes. HCT116 were transfected
with 20 μg Cas9 plasmid and 5 μg GFP plasmid by Lipo-
fectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 10 cm dishes. Twenty
micrograms of pX330 and 5 μg GFP were co-introduced
into K562 cells by nucleofector 4D with FF120 program
in SF buffer (Lonza). Cas9 inhibitor AcrIIA4 titration
libraries were prepared from cells co-transfected with 2 μg
Cas9:RAG1A plasmid, 6 μg AcrIIA4 plus blank plasmids
in indicated ratios, and 1 μg GFP plasmid by Ca-PO4 in
six-well dishes. For SaCas9:MYC1 libraries, 2 μg SaCas9:
MYC locus1 plasmid, 2 μg Cas9:RAG1A plasmid, 2 μg
AcrIIA4 or blank plasmid, and 1 μg GFP plasmid were co-
transfected into cells cultured in six-well dishes. For other
1:1 libraries, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 2 μg
pX330 plasmid, 2 μg AcrIIA4 or blank plasmid, and 1 μg
GFP plasmid. All the libraries were analyzed for GFP
co-transfection efficiency by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting 48 h after plasmid delivery.
“SuperQ” pipeline for PEM-seq analysis
Hiseq reads were processed as following. For initial
reads preprocessing, both Illumina adapter sequences and
ending low-quality sequences (QC < 30) were trimmed
by cutadapt (http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/);
remaining reads shorter than 25 bp were discarded. Then
reads were de-multiplexed using fastq-multx (https://
github.com/brwnj/fastq-multx) to distinguish index. For
reads alignment and clustering, we adapted corresponding
pipeline used in LAM-HTGTS9 to perform reads map-
ping and translocation break point detection. Note that
we used the hg38 genome as reference. Uniquely mapped
reads were filtered program as LAM-HTGTS did but
all the duplicates were kept for following precession. A
molecular barcode clustering algorithm38 was adapted
to remove PCR duplicates at an editing distance of 2.
Break-site and neighbor ±5 bp region was analyzed for
indels; reads containing large deletions resulting from
resection and rejoining in the break-site ±250 kb region
were also categorized as indels (I). Reads without any
detected mutations around break point were identified
as germline (G). Genome-wide translocation (T) was
identified as before. Taking uncut control and transfection
efficiency (TE) into account, the editing efficiency was
calculated as bellow:

where S represents the nuclease-treated library and C

Off-target hotspot identification
We excluded reads proximal to break-site (±250 kb) and
used MACS2 callpeak mode to identify translocation
enriched region: --extsize 50 -q 0.05 --llocal 10000000.
MACS2 results were further filtered to remove sites with
no target site-similar sequence or <3 junctions. A hotspot
with highly similar sequence as target site and/or definite
PAM and occurring in at least two library replicates
was considered as an off-target site9
. Briefly, the off-
target hotspots are recurrent in a focal region containing
cryptic target sequences and have a balanced directional
distribution with a center right at the presumable
cutting site. Yet, the off-target-independent translocations
are usually low frequent and have biased directional
distribution with no neighbor target-similar sequences.
Total number of junctions within ±500 bp of off-target
presumable cutting site was counted to calculate the
off-target intensity after normalization to uncut control
library:
