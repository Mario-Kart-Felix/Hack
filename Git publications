Walmart has challenged a logo's trademark application submitted by Kanye West's Yeezy brand.

Walmart says Yeezy's logo is so similar to its own that people may think the brands are affiliated.

The company said in a USPTO filing first reported by Bloomberg that this could hurt Walmart's brand.

Walmart has filed a complaint to the US Patent and Trademark Office, arguing that a proposed logo design for Kanye West's Yeezy brand looks too much like the retail giant's logo.
