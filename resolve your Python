Dependabot can't resolve your Python dependency files
Dependabot failed to update your dependencies because there was an error resolving your Python dependency files.

Dependabot encountered the following error:

Pipenv failed to install "opencv-python". This could be caused by missing system dependencies that can't be installed by Dependabot or required installation flags.

Error output from running "pipenv lock":

1 pillow vulnerability found in Pipfile.lock 12 days ago
Remediation
Upgrade pillow to version 8.1.2 or later. For example:

[packages]
pillow = ">=8.1.2"
orâ€¦
[dev-packages]
pillow = ">=8.1.2"
Always verify the validity and compatibility of suggestions with your codebase.

Details
GHSA-jgpv-4h4c-xhw3
moderate severity
Vulnerable versions: < 8.1.1
Patched version: 8.1.2
Impact
Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.

Patches
An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0. When reading specially crafted invalid image files, the library can either allocate very large amounts of memory or take an extremely long period of time to process the image.

Workarounds
An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0. When reading specially crafted invalid image files, the library can either allocate very large amounts of memory or take an extremely long period of time to process the image.
