If you have the CSS values as string and there is no other CSS already set for the element (or you don't care about overwriting), make use of the cssText property:

document.getElementById("myElement").style.cssText = "display: block; position: absolute";
This is good in a sense as it avoids repainting the element every time you change a property (you change them all "at once" somehow).

On the other side, you would have to build the string first.
