Dependency chains can answer the questions, "Is this dependency direct or transitive?" and "How did I bring this dependency into my code?".

Supported ecosystems
The Tidelift CLI leverages ecosystem specific tools to discover the source of dependencies in your project's bill of materials. The following ecosystems are currently supported, with more to come soon.
Java  - Maven or Gradle will be used depending upon your chosen toolset.
Javascript  - Both npm and Yarn will be supported soon.
With these ecosystem-native tools in place, you can use the tidelift alignment command to process a dependency chain:

tidelift alignment
This command will generate a bill of materials for a project and check its alignment with your catalog. When an alignment fails, it will give you a list of packages that are out of alignment, as well as a url to see more details. From this



By clicking into each see dependency chains link, you can see all of the direct dependencies that are bringing in deeper level transitive dependencies, and the chain structure.
