answer?” I replied.
“A complete answer,” he said. “I’m sick of these red marks that I don’t understand on my English papers!”
If you have ever gotten a red mark on an academic paper because you didn’t know how to write with relative pronouns correctly, here is an explanation, followed by a story you won’t soon forget, although you may want to.
Geeking out on relative pronouns
First, there are only three relative pronouns: “who,” “which,” and “that.” They “relate” the orphan clause that follows them to the noun just before them.
Example: She is the type of student WHO studies all night for a test.
She is the type of student — “student” is the noun just before the relative pronoun “who.” “Who” is a relative pronoun and will relate the words that follow it to “student.”
Studies all night for a test.
“Studies” is the verb that begins the orphan clause following the relative pronoun “who.”
In this sentence, “who” is the relative pronoun. “Studies all night for a test” is the orphan clause. Why is it called an orphan clause? No one knows for sure, but the reason that made sense to me was one that helped me remember it:
Every complete clause has a subject followed by a verb that goes with it. Remember that; it’s important. The subject is a noun or a pronoun that matches the verb in number (both are singular or both are plural). That’s called “subject-verb agreement.”
But the orphan clause has only a verb phrase, or “predicate”; “studies all night for a test.” It lacks a subject.
It’s missing the “head” of the clause. (Like missing the head of a household?)
In the example sentence, “who” is a pronoun.
A pronoun can be the subject of a sentence, aka the subject of a verb.
But is “who” the subject in this sentence?
Is “who” the one who “studies all night for a test”? Or does the student do that?
Who is performing the action?
Think about it. In the sentence we’re examining, which person is performing the action of the verb “studying”? That is what subjects do; they perform the action of the verb. So, who is studying all night?
Is it “who”? No, it is the student! Not “who.”
The pronoun “who” is a relative pronoun in this sentence. It is not the legitimate subject of the verb “studies.” But if it were an independent clause, or sentence, it is in the spot where the subject should be.
Remember, I said that every complete clause has a subject and a verb that goes with it. But after the word “who,” you don’t really have a clause at all. “Studies all night for a test” is what we call a “verb phrase,” not a complete clause — because it’s missing a subject.
Why not say “student” is the subject? After all, “student” is the one studying.
Can’t. The word “student” is not in the subject position, which would be directly before the verb “studies.” The relative pronoun “who” is in the way. (Half of learning English is figuring out the position of the words in the sentence — the order of the words, or the syntax — and what that position signifies.)
Thus, the words starting with “studies” comprise merely a verb phrase (a “predicate”) with no subject, as I noted earlier.
As such, I don’t think it should be called an orphan “clause” at all, because it isn’t even a clause! It doesn’t have a subject. But Strunk & White decided otherwise, and they didn’t ask me.
More important than you knew
You asked what purpose relative pronouns serve. Why do they exist at all?
In this kind of sentence, there will never be a legitimate subject for the orphan clause (poor thing — orphaned AND illegitimate!). With no subject to match it to, what number should the verb take — singular or plural? Should you use studies (singular) or study (plural)?
To find out, look just before the relative pronoun at the noun or pronoun in front of it. In this sentence, just before the relative pronoun “who,” there is a noun “student.”
“Student” is singular, right? So, you use the singular verb “studies” to begin the orphan clause.
Q. “Why do you match the verb back to the noun sitting BEFORE the relative pronoun?” you ask. Why not match it to the noun or pronoun at the beginning of the sentence, the legitimate subject of the sentence?”
A. “How much more time do you have?”
If the word in front of the relative pronoun had been “students” instead of “student,” you would have used the plural form of the verb “to study” after the relative pronoun to match the plural “students.”
The plural form of the verb is “study,” and that would match in number with a plural noun before the relative pronoun like “students.”
Here is what that sentence would look like:
She is one of those students WHO study all night for a test.
That sentence is correct because “students study”; students don’t “studies.”
What these examples demonstrate is that the relative pronoun ties (or “relates”) the verb just after it to the noun or pronoun just before it. Match that noun or pronoun in number (singular or plural) to the verb that begins the orphan clause.
Introducing the antecedent
Isn’t there a special name for that noun or pronoun that sits in front of the relative pronoun?
There sure is! Everything else in grammar has two or three labels. Why wouldn’t this? English is a wonderful language. The same word can be used as just about any part of speech, depending on where it sits in the sentence. The matter of what goes where in a sentence is a language field with the name “syntax,” but that’s a lesson for another day.
Here, the noun or pronoun just before the relative pronoun “who,” “which,” or “that” has a name, too: the “antecedent.” Remember that the Latin prefix “ante” means “before.” In this sentence, you can see that the antecedent appears just before the relative pronoun “who.”
Now you tell me?
The good news is that you need not remember the terms “relative pronoun,” “orphan clause,” or “antecedent” to write well. Just know what to match with what. The noun or pronoun just before the relative pronoun must match in number (singular or plural) with the verb that follows the relative pronoun.
There’s a shortcut to figuring out the right verb to use that doesn’t require memorizing any labels or grammar rules:
Now you tell me?
Mentally, remove the relative pronoun from the sentence.
Start reading the sentence out loud as though it began with the antecedent. Add “a” or “the” to the beginning of the sentence if it sounds truncated.
In this example, you would say out loud: “[A] student studies all night.” Both “student” and “studies” are singular.
If it had been plural, you’d say: “Students study all night.” Both are plural.
If it matches in number, you’re good to go.
How to impress your English teacher
If, for some reason, you WANT to remember the fancy grammar terms, the fairy tale below may help.
The Orphan (Clause) and the Ante(cedent)
Once upon a time, there was an orphan (clause). She had no parents, no head of the family (missing the rest of the clause). Just a poor orphan (clause) alone in the world.
Although her situation would normally receive lots of sympathy, she doesn’t get much because she is kind of a pain in the you-know-what. She is hyperactive, but not getting any treatment for it. As a result, many observers judge her behavior as out of line. Instead of doing what she is told to do, half the time she’s dancing up and down the stairs with her buddies.

In this story, you must imagine Shirley Temple in the lead role of the orphan.)
All action, all the time? Sounds like the hyperactive orphan (clause) could be a verb phrase!
Does the orphan have relatives after all?
She doesn’t know it, but she has an auntie (antecedent) who is looking for her. They have lots in common, but they don’t know that yet.
The ante(cedent) bumps into a distant relative (relative pronoun). He has seen the orphan (clause) and thinks he knows where she may be staying, not too far away.
The kind relative (pronoun) connects the ante(cedent) with the orphan (clause). Both the orphan (clause) and the ante(cedent) cannot contain their excitement when they finally meet.
Matching in number
It’s a hot day, so they take off their jackets. Immediately, they notice they are both wearing matching white blouses with yellow polka dots. Even stranger, they can see that their blouses match not only in the color and style of their garment, but in the total number of yellow polka dots on them. Each blouse has 97 yellow polka dots exactly!
The relative (pronoun) just smiles at the two of them as they compulsively count the number of polka dots on the other’s blouse. He said he knew they would be a great match (in number).
The orphan (clause) moves in with the ante(cedent), her only living relative aside from the relative pronoun. It doesn’t take long for the orphan (clause) and the ante(cedent) to build a strong bond between them. Even the orphan (clause)’s hyperactive behavior calms down.
The distant relative (pronoun), now impossible to imagine as anything but a close connection to both of them, comes for dinner every Sunday, and they all live happily ever after.
Take-away
When you read or work on a sentence containing “who,” “which,” or “that,” check whether that word is acting as a relative pronoun. Is there an orphan (clause) following it?
If so, find the verb at the beginning of the orphan clause, the word that appears just after the relative pronoun. Make a note of it. Determine the number of that verb (singular or plural).
Next, find the antecedent. Remember that it is the noun that sits directly before the “who,” “which,” or “that.” Make a note of it. Determine the number of the antecedent (singular or plural).
Finally, make the number of the antecedent and the number of the verb at the beginning of the orphan clause match. Both must be singular (as in “a student studies”), or both plural (as in “students study”).
If you can accomplish that correctly, you have succeeded in achieving “agreement” in a sentence that contains a relative pronoun.
Your sentence will make more sense and read more smoothly. (And your English teacher will be proud of you.)
