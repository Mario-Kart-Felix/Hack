Compatible languages and package files
Tidelift is compatible with many different package manager ecosystems.

We generate a bill of materials for your project with the same files used by package managers. A manifest file describes your application's direct requirements, while a lockfile snapshots exact versions and transitive dependencies at a moment in time. Tidelift can generate the most complete bill of materials if we have both files.

ivy.xml
gradle-dependencies-q.txt (run gradle dependencies -q > gradle-dependencies-q.txt and upload gradle-dependencies-q.txt with that exact name)
xml files from your .ivy2 directory
maven-resolved-dependencies.txt (run mvn dependency:list -DoutputFile=maven-resolved-dependencies.txt and upload maven-resolved-dependencies.txt with that exact name). More information on how to use the plugin can be found in the Dependency Plugin Documentation .
sbt-update-full.txt (run sbt 'show updateFull' > sbt-update-full.txt and upload sbt-update-full.txt with that exact name; note that the single quotes around 'show updateFull' are required)
Rust (Cargo)

Cargo.lock
Beta Compatible
We have beta compatibility for quite a few other package managers. If you try these and have feedback for us, please email support@tidelift.com.

Note that this beta list is not yet subject to our full scope of support for paying subscribers. However, if you are a subscriber we'd love to extend our coverage to the package managers you care about.

npm
npm-shrinkwrap.json
Note that package.json, package-lock.json, and yarn.lock are in the fully-supported list above
RubyGems
gems.rb
gems.locked
Note that *.gemspec, Gemfile, and Gemfile.lock are in the fully-supported list above
PyPi
setup.py
req*.txt
req*.pip
requirements/*.pip
Note that requirements.txt, Pipfile, and Pipfile.lock are in the fully-supported list above
Maven
build.gradle (sometimes we can get something from this, but rarely; it's better to upload gradle-dependencies-q.txt as noted in the fully-supported list above)
Note that pom.xml, ivy.xml, gradle-dependencies-q.txt, .ivy2 cache xml files, and sbt updateFull output are in the fully-supported list above.
