If you need the push event to trigger other workflows, use a repo scoped Personal Access Token.

      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
actions/checkout@v1 (original answer)

The problem is that the actions/checkout@v1 action leaves the git repository in a detached HEAD state. See this issue about it for more detailed information: https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/6

The workaround I have used successfully is to setup the remote as follows:

git remote set-url origin https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/username/repository
You may also need to checkout. You can extract the branch name from the GITHUB_REF:

git checkout "${GITHUB_REF:11}"
Here is a complete example to demonstrate.

name: Push commit example
on: push
jobs:
  report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Create report file
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Commit report
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
          git config --global user.email 'your-username@users.noreply.github.com'
          git remote set-url origin https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY
          git checkout "${GITHUB_REF:11}"
          git commit -am "Automated report"
          git push
By the way, I have written a GitHub action which may help you achieve what you want to do. It will take any changes made locally during a workflow, commit them to a new branch and raise a pull request. https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request
