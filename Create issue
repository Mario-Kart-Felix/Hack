Is this something that should be fixed upstream?
If so, can we fix it by pinning to a specific version of nevergrad (or a dependency) that works without the warning?

Alternatively, we can:

create an issue in nevergrad to ask them to pin to cma==3.0.3
and/or
pin to that version cma==3.0.3 in nevergrad sweeper ourselves.
This warning only get issued when matplotlib is not installed - I think it makes more sense for us to filter it during testing.
